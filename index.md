# About me

Hi! I'm **Adrià Sellarés**, a **C++ developer** focused on game development. My focus is mainly on **game engine programming and graphics programming**, but I've worked on many projects as a gameplay programmer.
I also have some background on C# and Unity development.

I'm very passionate about coding and I love the process of solving **gargantuan problems**. Also, I've been **working on teams** since I started to code, and I'm really used to **sharing ideas** and **communicating** during the process of solving said problems.

I've been a **code lead** for a student project that went for 4 months (check **"GOTG: The Bet"** below!), which made me learn tons about **cooperation and time managment** in the coding field.
